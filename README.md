        <img src="images/autobiography.jpg" alt="Cristine Mae Ella" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 200px; border-radius: 10px;">
        <p>
            Cristine Mae Gubaya Ella was born on February 24, 2004, lives in San Pascual Bacon District Sorsogon City,  a place far from civilization but quite and peaceful. She is currently 20 years old turning 21 this 2025. One of her passion is watching movies and series, action is her favourite genre. “Mistah”, the movie of Robin Padilla is one of  her favourite  and she watched it repeatedly  cause aside from being based on true events, what she appreciates most about this movie is how it reflects unity, compassion for others, and love for one’s country. And we can reflect in this movie the life of a soldier that is willing to sacrifice his life and personal happiness for his beloved nation and the duty he has sworn to uphold.

Cristine’s father is Jose Noel Ansus Ella Sr., 56 years old and doesn’t have a permanent job. He engages in farming and fishing to support his family. He’s strict yet caring father who prioritize his family needs. Her mother Elvie Gubaya Ella is 54 years old, and like her husband she doesn’t have a permanent job. She is a loving , caring  and kind wife and also a mother. But her kindness sometimes lead to her  being taken advantage of. The couple instilled in their childrens mind that poverty shouldn’t hinder them from achieving their dreams. They want their children to be respectful to everyone around them as they grow older. 

When Cristine was just a child, one of her dreams was to gain her father’s attention and appreciation. She did everything she could to make him proud, she participate in school activities in her elementary days and she even depend all his decisions to what her father wants, without considering if she wants it or not. In her 5th  grade in elementary, she won a gold medal as the champion in a 1,000 meter run in Balogo Elementary School. That day she’s very happy and proud to herself and she hoped that her achievement would finally make her father proud. However, contrary to her expectation, her father seemed indifferent to her hard earned medal. He doesn’t even ask her daughter about the game and how is she. From that moment on, Cristine lost her enthusiasm and grew distant from her father. 

Now, she thinks that choosing criminology as her college course was out of foolishness, as it was her father’s dream when she was just a child. She thinks that because of her desperate need for her father’s attention led her to choose these course. Cristine is now a  2nd year  college student in Sorsogon College of Criminology Inc. She is happy in her journey as a criminology student, but she still have a lot of questions whether this is truly the path she wants to pursue. Still she make a promise to herself that she will graduate to her choosen course and repay all the sacrifices her family has made for her. Though she doesn’t know what profession she will pursue in the future, but she’s willing to try becoming a police officer if given the opportunity. The lesson she wants to share to everyone is to always look back where you come from and be grateful to all the people that been part of your life and success. Never be overly arrogant upon reaching the top, cause there’s nothing permanent in this world. It’s essential to maintain respect, humbleness and discipline.
